    <h1>Spot-Emotion: Song Classifier Based on Emotion</h1>
    <img src="General Pictures/Updated Infographic.png" alt="Infographic" class="center">
    <p>The music streaming industry is one of the largest sectors of the entertainment industry, representing a 10.2-billion-dollar revenue stream in 2022 alone [1]. This industry is also highly competitive, and players are consistently looking at methods to optimize the listening experience for their users. One of the primary methods in which this is accomplished is through song recommendations based on listening patterns. Currently, this is primarily done using concrete attributes of music, such as tempo, lyrics, and artists to name a few. While this is an adequate first step, there are methods in which this can be improved. Emotion and music are significantly interlinked, with emotions affecting music choice and vice versa [2]. Singh & Goyal (2018) discuss the effect music has on emotion, and this is the motivation behind focusing on this new classification model [3]. Our team aims to improve the song recommendation concept by developing a tool that can classify songs on Spotify based on the primary emotion presented by the song. The primary emotions will be classified using Thayerâ€™s mood model [4]. By developing this additional classification, our group sees potential in the application of this technology to further improve music recommendation technology and provide a better overall user experience.</p>
