    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <img src="Infographic.jpg" alt="Infographic" class="center">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The music streaming industry is one of the largest sectors of the entertainment industry, representing a 10.2 billion dollar revenue stream in 2022 alone [1]. This industry is also highly competitive, and players are consistently looking at methods to optimize the listening experience for their users. One of the primary methods in which this is accomplished is through song recommendations based on listening patterns. Currently, this is primarily done using concrete attributes of music, such as tempo, lyrics and artists to name a few. While this is an adequate first step, there are methods in which this can be improved. Emotion and music are significantly interlinked, with emotions affecting music choice and vice versa [2]. Based on this, our team aims to improve the song recommendation concept by developing a tool that can classify songs on Spotify based on the primary emotion presented by the song. By developing this additional classification, our group sees potential in the application of this technology to further improve music recommendation technology and provide a better overall user experience. </p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quam nam laborum, nesciunt alias error, dignissimos velit aliquid magni a minima incidunt deleniti ullam explicabo itaque delectus quos tempora? Consequatur, quam.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The expected results of this project are to be able to classify individual songs based on their primary emotion. The metric for success would be at minimum 25% sorting accuracy. This is the value that the system would theoretically get right by chance, so it makes sense that the tool should outperform this metric. The metrics for success would mainly be precision. This is because we are more focused on minimizing mistakes in the outputs rather than completely representing the target ground truths. A possible metric for Unsupervised Learning would be the Silhouette Coefficient to understand the goodness of the clusters. A possible metric would be the Rand Statistic for Supervised Learning to determine the fraction of accurately sorted songs. The mid-term “exam” for this system will be the Unsupervised Learning portion of the project. The final “exam” will be the Supervised Learning portion of the project. In both exams we will determine, based on the metric of success, whether the tool is capable of sorting the songs properly.</p>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>With the ever-growing set of music available to the public, it becomes overwhelming at times to find new music, and many times music may be lost in the sea of new content available. Using this tool, consumers would be provided with music which matches the primary emotion in the songs they listen to and allow for a more positive response to recommendations. Additionally, the system could sort and build playlists based on a core emotion for users, again allowing consumers to reach music which they may not be able to find from a simple search.</p>
